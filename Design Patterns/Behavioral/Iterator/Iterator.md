# Iterator Design Pattern

## ❇️ Description:
Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that lets us traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc). It falls under **behavioral** pattern category. We use this pattern when we need to "abstractify" the traversal of wildly different data structures so that algorithms can be defined that are capable of interfacing with each transparently.
